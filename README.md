## Essential Tools and Supplies
To successfully build your FPV drone, you’ll need the following tools and supplies. Some of these items may already be in your toolkit, while others can be easily found online or at your local hardware store:
- Soldering Iron and solder
- Soldering Flux
- A pair of scissors for stripping and cutting wires
- Shrinkable tube to organize wires
- 3M double sided foam tape
-A collection of 2mm wide zip ties (ideally 15cm or longer)

## iFlight Chimera 7 pro V2 (Frame)

The iFlight Chimera7 is a 7.5" longrange frame designed to give maximum stability and flight time during your cinematic shoots.

Fly smooth lines on the waterfront all the way to the Swiss Alps if you want! Made from a super-stiff carbon for minimum resonance and recommended 2806.5 motors for maximum 7.5" prop control.

Fly big batteries top-mounted, or even bigger batteries bottom-mounted, 6 cells recommended or 5 cells for slow cruising. But whatever style you fly, a Lipo or Lion pack will do the job.

## IFlight BLITZ F7 (Stack)
